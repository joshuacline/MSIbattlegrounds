# Microsoft Security Intelligence Battlegrounds

- ![Alt text](/scales_of_justice.jpg "")


Over the past month, Microsoft Security Intelligence's incompetence has damaged my reputation to an irrepairable state.
Microsoft Security Intelligence continues to deny that there are any current malware detections.
That has been determined to be a lie. With that said, the damage has already been done.
I have retained legal counsel and will be pursuing these matters in court.
Here is where I will be posting correspondence, updates, and interactions with corporate cretins.
Please feel free to share with any media publications, as I will be doing the same.
Will be setting up a go-fund-me, stay tuned.


# Google Reminds Us They Still Have A Voice (02_06_2026):
- Sick and tired of being unheard, Google has thrown its vote into the mix.
- Not exactly the corporation that comes to mind for expertise in PowerShell, CommandShell, or anything relating to Windows, however none of this matters when you're dealing with obesity of this magnitude.

- At this juncture, the GUI .ps1 script has been integrated into the .cmd file.
- Soft velvet gloves slapping a generic 'Detected' label onto 'Gploy', whilst a mysterious third party going by the name 'Varist' takes the bullet.

- Lacking any definitions or even a single reference in the English dictionary, Google's Gemini does the deciphering.
- Frustrating as it may be for Google, not having intellectual property ownership of letter 'G' somewhere within its portfolio, they recognize a 'G' when they see one.🥇

# The Sky Is Not The Limit, But The Beginning (08_11_2025):
- Unrelated to Microsoft Security Intelligence, however is being mentioned for reference.
- Unlike MSI, SkyHigh's naming scheme is logical, doesn't contain inflammatory language, and is indeed fitting.

- ![Alt text](/bucolic_green_hills_ca.jpg "")

- Note: The .ps1 script is merely a GUI wrapper for the .cmd script, and does not provide additional functionality aside from .iso mount & dismount during the import of boot & installation media, and building lists (plain text files) natively from within the GUI.
- This new detection has occurred without any changes being made to the .ps1 script.
- The 'BehavesLikeDropper' moniker makes sense, as it creates an individualized .cmd per each 'command' list item during list execution. Usage of command list items are completely optional for the end-user.

- Skyhigh: A vendor that went unnoticed, that is, until receiving their endorsement.🏆

# Whack-A-Mole with Microsoft Security Intelligence's Windows Defender; Repeat Offender, But With a Twist (07_22_2025):
- With development no longer being held hostage from spooky 'Wacatac' warnings issued to users upon download, Microsoft Security Intelligence takes aim with a new threat label: Puwaders.
- To reiterate, Microsoft Security Intelligence is the only vendor out of 62 anti-malware companies with these 'issues'.
- Two archives, one detection, identical contents.

- ![Alt text](/virustotal_results_07_22_2025_ziparchive.png "")
- No sign of Puwaders when the files are submitted individually. Mysterious.
- ![Alt text](/virustotal_results_07_22_2025_individualized.png "")
- A text comparison of the source files contained within the two zip archives (BCompare). Note that 'binary same' indicates the compared files are exact binary copies.

# Microsoft Security Intelligence's Libelous Terminologies Part 2; Wading Through Weaponized Pu (07_22_2025):
- Once again void of description, detail, technical information, threat behavior, or summary of any kind, to which the observer is left with a pooey taste, plus a scary warning during download, courtesy of Windows Defender. Which frankly is more than enough to deter any potential user of the program.
- Note: Microsoft has plans to update the current 'threat actor' naming scheme to a more palatable 'weather themed taxonomy' as indicated.
- ![Alt text](/microsoft_security_intelligence_Puwaders.png "")
- In search of clarification, a query on Webster's Dictionary manages to provide significantly more information.

# Microsoft Security Intelligence's Serial Bungling; Utter Incompetence or Deliberate Malicious Mishandling? (07_19_2025):

- A competitor's point of view, the first of many. Organizations redacted.

# Microsoft Security Intelligence Email & Retractions; Referred to as 'Recall' (07_13_2025):

- ![Alt text](/email_07132025_01.png "")

# Microsoft Security Intelligence's Libelous Terminologies; A Brief Lesson in Semantics (07_12_2025):
- Void of description, detail, technical information, threat behavior, or summary of any kind, to which the observer is left with a default inference: Literal terminology.
- ![Alt text](/microsoft_security_intelligence_Wacatac.png "")

- Precise verbiage for this slanderous 'attack' has been located.
