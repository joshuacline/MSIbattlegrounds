# Microsoft Security Intelligence Battlegrounds

- ![Alt text](/scales_of_justice.jpg "")


Over the past month, Microsoft Security Intelligence's incompetence has damaged my reputation to an irrepairable state.
Microsoft Security Intelligence continues to deny that there are any current malware detections.
That has been determined to be a lie. With that said, the damage has already been done.
I have retained legal counsel and will be pursuing these matters in court.
Here is where I will be posting correspondence, updates, and interactions with corporate cretins.
Please feel free to share with any media publications, as I will be doing the same.
Will be setting up a go-fund-me, stay tuned.


# Whack-A-Mole with Microsoft Security Intelligence's Windows Defender; Repeat Offender, But With a Twist (07_22_2025):
- With development no longer being held hostage from spooky 'Wacatac' warnings issued to users upon download, Microsoft Security Intelligence takes aim with a new threat label: Puwaders.
- To reiterate, Microsoft Security Intelligence is the only vendor out of 62 anti-malware companies with these 'issues'.
- Two archives, one detection, identical contents.

- No sign of Puwaders when the files are submitted individually. Mysterious.

- A text comparison of the source files contained within the two zip archives (BCompare). Note that 'binary same' indicates the compared files are exact binary copies.

# Microsoft Security Intelligence's Libelous Terminologies Part 2; Wading Through Weaponized Pu (07_22_2025):
- Once again void of description, detail, technical information, threat behavior, or summary of any kind, to which the observer is left with a pooey taste, plus a scary warning during download, courtesy of Windows Defender. Which frankly is more than enough to deter any potential user of the program.
- Note: Microsoft has plans to update the current 'threat actor' naming scheme to a more palatable 'weather themed taxonomy' as indicated.

- In search of clarification, a query on Webster's Dictionary manages to provide significantly more information.

# Microsoft Security Intelligence's Libelous Terminologies; A Brief Lesson in Semantics (07_12_2025):
- Void of description, detail, technical information, threat behavior, or summary of any kind, to which the observer is left with a default inference: Literal terminology.

- Precise verbiage for this slanderous 'attack' has been located.
