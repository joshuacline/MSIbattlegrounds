# Microsoft Security Intelligence Battlegrounds

- ![Alt text](/scales_of_justice.jpg "")


Over the past month, Microsoft Security Intelligence's incompetence has damaged my reputation to an irrepairable state.
Microsoft Security Intelligence continues to deny that there are any current malware detections.
That has been determined to be a lie. With that said, the damage has already been done.
I have retained legal counsel and will be pursuing these matters in court.
Here is where I will be posting correspondence, updates, and interactions with corporate cretins.
Please feel free to share with any media publications, as I will be doing the same.
Will be setting up a go-fund-me, stay tuned.
